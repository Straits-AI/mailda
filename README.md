# Mailda

Shared inboxes that know who replied.

If two people have ever answered the same customer email, or nobody could tell you whether
`invoices@` got a response, or your shared inbox is a Gmail account four people know the
password to — that's the problem. Mailda turns email addresses into governed work
endpoints: assignment, collision detection, cases, approvals, audit, and deterministic
automation, with AI available only where you explicitly put it.

It runs entirely in **your own Cloudflare account**. You own the domains, the message data,
the encryption keys, the model keys and the bill. There is no Mailda service to depend on,
no licence server, and no telemetry. Disconnect us and nothing stops working.

## Status: designed, not built

**This is not deployable software yet.** Saying otherwise would be the kind of overclaim
the project's own working agreement forbids.

What exists today:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Product contract** | [`Mailda-Full-Engineering-Blueprint.md`](./Mailda-Full-Engineering-Blueprint.md) — 2,446 lines specifying the target state, with 24 locked architectural decisions |
| **Working agreement** | [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) — how decisions get made and what counts as done |
| **Decisions taken** | 20 recorded with full reasoning and rejected alternatives, on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Straits-AI/mailda/issues/1) |
| **Measurements** | 8 receipts in [`docs/receipts/`](./docs/receipts/) generating 54 verified constants |
| **Code** | A measurement harness and one Worker. 34 tests. Not a product. |

Nothing here receives mail yet.

## What's distinctive about how it's built

**Every number has a receipt.** No limit, timeout, threshold or budget enters the codebase
without a measurement behind it. The constants are *generated from* the receipt files, so
you cannot write the number — only the measurement. See
[`docs/receipts/`](./docs/receipts/) and the rule in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

That has already earned its place. Measuring the authorization path found a **full table
scan on every request** — 1,864 rows read where 7 were needed, growing linearly with
organisation size. It would have shipped invisibly.
([receipt](./docs/receipts/authz-check-rows-read.md))

**Honest semantics are enforced, not aspired to.** A forwarded copy is called a copy, never
a sync. A provider action Mailda observed after the fact is never described as approved.
When a send outcome is genuinely unknown, the product says `outcome unknown` rather than
guessing. Names must mean the same thing in the code, the CLI, the API and the UI.

**Structural over disciplined.** Where a rule could be a code-review convention, it's made
into something a build can check instead: no Cloudflare resource in two Worker configs, no
queue without a dead-letter queue, no retryable table without a unique constraint, no bare
`Date.now()` outside one module.

## What it will need from you

| | |
|---|---|
| A Cloudflare account | Free to create |
| A domain you control | Or a delegated subdomain — `mail.example.com` is the default. **Pointing MX at Cloudflare is required**; nothing avoids it |
| **Workers Paid — mandatory** | **$5/month minimum**, 3,000 emails included, then $0.35/1,000 |
| Inbound mail | Unlimited, included |

A 20-person organisation sending 10,000 emails a month costs roughly **$7.45/month**, plus
storage. ([receipt](./docs/receipts/cloudflare-plan-costs.md))

**There is no free tier.** Not a pricing choice — Cloudflare's free plan forces 24-hour,
non-configurable queue retention, so a message stuck in a queue for a day is silently
deleted. A mail system cannot run there. `mailda deploy` detects the plan and refuses,
saying why, rather than failing later. ([ADR 25](./Mailda-Full-Engineering-Blueprint.md))

### Deliberate limitations

- **No Gmail or Microsoft 365 connector.** Adopting Mailda means moving mail to it. There's
  no import path for existing history. ([why](./Mailda-Full-Engineering-Blueprint.md))
- **No IMAP, JMAP or SMTP mailbox service.** The web app is the only way to read mail — no
  Outlook, Apple Mail or Thunderbird.
- **5 MiB outbound** to arbitrary recipients, and 50 recipients per message. A Node can
  receive a 25 MiB attachment and be unable to reply with it.
- **Cloudflare is a hard dependency.** You own your data and your bill; the Node is not
  portable to another platform.
- **Not for bulk or marketing mail.** Transactional and operational only.

## Contributing

Read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) first — it's short, and it's binding on humans and agents
equally. Work is tracked as a [wayfinder map](https://github.com/Straits-AI/mailda/issues/1):
one issue holds the route, each child issue holds one decision and the argument for it.

Open questions live there. Closed ones record what was rejected and why, which is usually
the more useful half.

## Licence

Not yet chosen. Blueprint §30 covers the intent; the decision is open.
