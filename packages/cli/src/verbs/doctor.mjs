/**
 * Reads a running Node's own verdict.
 *
 * Over HTTP rather than by importing the checks, and that is the point: `runDoctor` needs the Worker's
 * bindings — D1, R2, the vault, the queue — so the only place it can answer honestly is inside the Worker.
 * A CLI that re-implemented the checks would be a second opinion about the Node's health, produced without
 * access to the things it is judging.
 *
 * **The text comes from the Node too.** `/api/doctor?format=text` renders `formatReport`, so this prints
 * what the Node wrote rather than a second spelling of the same layout — the first draft of this file
 * carried its own copy, which is exactly the drift this repository keeps paying for.
 *
 * ## Signing in, and why a claimed Node needs it
 *
 * The report is public on an **unclaimed** Node and gated once claimed — with one exception the route calls
 * out: if the Node cannot authenticate anybody at all, the gate is not one a caller can satisfy, so a
 * reduced report is served instead of a 401. That exception is the reason this command is worth having, and
 * it is also why credentials are optional here: the moment you most need `doctor` is the moment you cannot
 * sign in.
 *
 * Credentials come from the environment rather than the command line, which is `axe.mjs`'s rule and the
 * same one `set-password` follows: a password on a command line ends up in shell history.
